Final fix package (confession_final_fix2)

- Background displayed via ./background.jpg (already included). UI overlays are transparent so your background fully shows.
- Click "进入表白" to enter; poem is shown line-by-line; music auto-detected (music.mp3 or music.flac); lyrics auto-loaded from lyrics.lrc and synchronized.
- Lyrics sync fixed: only syncs while audio is playing, uses binary search and centers current line; user scroll will pause auto-scroll for 6s.
- If you still see a pink overlay, clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5) and ensure background.jpg is present in repo root.
