Two-page confession package (pure color, rounded font, background image as cover)

Files:
- index.html  (entry page with flower click)
- love.html   (confession page: poem + player + lyrics)
- style.css
- script.js
- background.jpg (your background image - used as page background)
- music.mp3 (optional)
- lyrics.lrc (included)

Notes:
- Background image is used as page background (cover the viewport). Other elements are transparent overlays so they won't block the background.
- To use your own color, edit --poem-color in style.css (choose cyan or pink).
- Upload files to your GitHub repo root and enable Pages (branch: main or gh-pages depending on settings).
