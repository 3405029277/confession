Final fixed package — overwrite your GitHub repo root with these files:

- index.html
- love.html
- style.css
- script.js
- background.jpg (your background image)
- music.mp3 (your audio file)
- lyrics.lrc (LRC lyrics file)
- flower.png (optional)

Instructions:
1. Upload these files to your repository root and enable GitHub Pages (main branch / root).
2. Visit https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/ and click "进入表白".
3. Poem will type in the left poem area with fixed rainbow gradient; player and lyrics are on the right.
4. If anything still overlays, clear browser cache (强制刷新) and test on desktop for debugging.

If you want, I can push these files into your GitHub repo for you — tell me your repo settings (or allow me to create a PR).
